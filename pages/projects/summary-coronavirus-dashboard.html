										This is my first attempt at a dashboard. I have picked up Tableau over the last few weeks. 
										I thought this analysis was a fitting start to this journey. I recently lost my summer 
										internship due to COVID-19. The main purpose of picking up Tableau was to utilize during 
										the internship. Nevertheless, it is a great skill to be able to say I am proficient at.
									</br></br>
										For this project, I wanted to incorporate as many new programming techniques as possible 
										using R and Tableau. The first step was to find reliable data for my analysis. Like many 
										news reports and articles, I found the most reliable source to be data from John Hopkins 
										University. The data is updated daily and easy to retrieve using R. I built an R script 
										to download the CSV file from John Hopkins' 
										<a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19" target="_blank" \>GitHub</a> page. 
										The script downloads data on the global, state, and county levels. I was interested in 
										statistics not directly given in the data, such as new confirmed cases and new deaths per 
										day. The raw data provides a lot of location information, dates, confirmed cases, and 
										confirmed deaths. I manipulated the data to make new columns for the statistics I was 
										interested in using dplyr. I also reduced the data size by removing the location columns 
										I had no use for. File size ended up being important when working with Tableau Public which 
										I learned painfully along the way.
									</br></br>
										Twenty hours of painstaking trial and error later, I had finally created files for world, 
										state, and county level data in the form that best fit my needs in Tableau. With the future 
										in mind, I wanted to find a way to update my dashboards automatically. After a few quick 
										searches, I was able to find a package called TaskscheduleR. This is a package in R that 
										gives easy setup for scripts to run automatically in the background of a computer. I set my 
										script to run daily. Running the script automatically was the easy part. Finding a way to have 
										Tableau utilize the refreshed data was another beast.
									</br></br>
										The best solution I was able to find was having my script upload the refreshed data to Google 
										Drive. Again, I found an R package, googledrive, that made somewhat easy work of this. The 
										package is new and does not have a lot of documentation on its variety of uses. I needed a 
										way to upload my data into Google Drive as a Google Sheet as to not require the use of memory 
										and to later use with Tableau Public. After some trial and error, my final script is able to 
										retrieve fresh data every day and update the data in Google Drive.
									</br></br>
										The hardest part of this analysis was the data retrieval, but I was able to learn many new 
										skills in R that will be useful for my future. Most of the data visualization in Tableau is 
										making nice graphs and tables using skills learned in the first courses of the Tableau classes 
										online. Dashboards and calculations were all taught in this course. I created some interesting 
										statistics, such as doubling time and growth rate using Tableau. Everything else was a matter of 
										deciding what looked best and how to present a large amount of information in a clean, user friendly way. 
										Google Sheets and Tableau Public work well together so I was able to connect the two very 
										quickly. The final product is a dashboard with automatically updated data. The county level is 
										not automatic due to the file size being too large to be automatic in Tableau Public.
									</br></br>
										The final step was putting it here on my website and taking a few insights from what can be 
										gathered in the dashboards. Tableau Public makes it very easy to embed dashboards for a 
										programmer's own use. The code for doing so was created by Tableau so I added the code to my 
										HTML files for the website pages. The dashboards turned out well. A few key takeaways are the upward trending doubling 
										time. The growth in number of confirmed cases is dropping significantly. There is a lag between 
										confirmed cases and confirmed deaths, but the measures taken by the government seem to have been useful. 
										I encourage you to play around with the dashboards and create your own insights.
