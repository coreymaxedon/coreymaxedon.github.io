										The idea started in the fall of 2017, the start of my Junior year. I
										was taking my very first class in Probability and Statistics with a
										new mathematics professor, Dr. Vin Isaia. We hit it off and connected
										right away. I had recently left Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology the year before as did he.
										Since the Honors College had an advanced curriculum requirement, I
										decided to make this one of my upgraded Honors classes.
									</p>
									<p>
										Dr. Isaia was the first person who showed me the beauty and power of
										computing. During class one day, he had mentioned the idea of a binomial
										process. Knowing I was of a finance background, he zeroed in on this idea
										and related it to how options are priced. We were able to go through the
										basics of options and most importantly the ways they are priced. Since
										Dr. Isaia was not a finance PhD, the jargon sometimes went over our head so
										I reached out to a close mentor of mine in the business college, Dr. Reza Houston.
										I owe a lot of the success of this thesis to these two individuals. Without them
										pushing me to learn and discover new ideas in their respective fields, I know I
										would not be where I am today.
									</p>
									<p>
										After diving deeper into this topic through the rest of the fall 2017 semester, I
										knew options pricing would be a great topic for my honors thesis requirement for
										the Honors College. At this point, I was ahead of the game. Most students take
										the thesis class the fall of their senior year. This gave me an extra semester to
										jump start my programming and finance knowledge on options. The end result was a
										satisfying experience.
									</p>
									<p>
										I was able to finish my thesis early and focus on my presentation of these
										complex ideas. I am highly satisfied with the deliverable I created
										which you can find below. It turns out I was not the only one who was satisfied
										with my work. The Honors College reached out to me and presented me with opportunities
										to discuss my research. By the end of my senior year, I was able to present on the
										topic on 5 separate occasions:
									</br></br>
										- Verbal for ISU Foundation Board at Indiana State University on April 26, 2019
									</br>
										- Poster for Mideast Honors Association at Ball State University on April 5-7, 2019
									</br>
										- Poster for ISU Day at the Statehouse at Indiana State Capitol Building on March 11, 2019
									</br>
										- Verbal for Meeting of the Deans at Indiana State University on March 2019
									</br>
										- Poster for Honors Thesis Symposium at Indiana State University on December 6, 2018
									</p>
									<p>
										It has been a rewarding experience to learn and understand a topic more fully outside
										of the classroom and then go on to present this research to people from a multitude of
										backgrounds. Indiana State University gave me several opportunities to refine my skills
										both on the analytical and personable spectrum. It has developed me into a better
										researcher and presenter. Statistics is built on these ideas of developing an abstract
										thought and then being able to go present it in a digestible way to people of all
										backgrounds. It will be fun to see where these skills take me in the future.
										Check out the full thesis below.

										Abstract:
									</br>
										This paper is directed toward a mathematical audience and looks at options,
										or derivatives, from a computational standpoint using computer programming
										with Python. A history of two options pricing formulas is given: the binomial
										pricing model and Black-Scholesâ€™ formula (Cox, Ross, & Rubinstein, 1979;
										Black & Scholes, 1973). The two formulas are compared against one another to
										see the benefits of each. The Black-Scholes model is by far the superior way
										of pricing options. The binomial pricing model has a limit of Black-Scholes
										formula. The Black-Scholes model is tested against real world data, but
										significant error is found. The error can give an implied volatility for the
										stock, which indicates current stock volatility rather than historic.
										Black-Scholes can also use the error to find arbitrage opportunities in the
										market. I created a new options trading strategy using Python that gives a
										list of ranked arbitrage opportunities for all options in an option chain.
										The program lets the user know the optimal strike price to buy and sell put
										and call options in order to benefit on the arbitrage opportunities at hand.
										The future for options trading and pricing has not lost its significance since
										finding the solution 45 years ago.
